GFU Geophysical utilities

DESCRIPTION

GFU contains several utilities developed in the course of the author's work with
large geophysical models.

REGRID_LL
  Utility for interpolating geophysical layered fields onto a different
  horizontal grid. It targets geographic grids with nodes defined in lat/lon and
  provides robust interpolation on sphere, including topologically complicated
  cases (e.g. tripolar grids, grids with discontinuities in node coordinates
  etc.). The source and destination horizontal grids can be either structured
  ([j][i]) or unstructured ([i]). The vertical layers are interpolated
  sequentially.

NCAVE
  Utility for averaging very large ensemble dumps. Compared to NCEA/NCRA it (1)
  conserves memory by averaging on layer-by-layer basis, and (2) when run on
  multiple CPUs processes layers in parallel. Note that for optimal efficiency
  the input dumps must be chunked by layers.

NCCAT
  Concatenates variables in NetCDF files by arbitrary dimensions.
