GFU Geophysical utilities

DESCRIPTION

GFU contains several utilities developed in the course of the author's work with
large geophysical models.

Except NCCAT, these utilities process the data by layers, and therefore perform
best with data chunked by layers (which should be the case for layered
geophysical models).

REGRID_LL
  Utility for horizontal interpolation of geophysical layered fields. It targets
  geographic grids with nodes defined in lat/lon and provides robust
  interpolation on sphere, including topologically complicated cases (e.g.
  tripolar grids, grids with discontinuities in node coordinates etc.).
  The source and destination horizontal grids can be either structured
  ([j][i]) or unstructured ([i]).

NCAVE
  Utility for averaging very large ensemble dumps. Compared to NCEA/NCRA it (1)
  conserves memory by averaging on layer-by-layer basis, and (2) when run on
  multiple CPUs processes layers in parallel. Note that for best performance
  the input dumps must be chunked by layers.

NCCAT
  Concatenates variables in NetCDF files over arbitrary dimensions.

NCD2F
  Converts double variables to float. Aimed at reducing size of large restart
  dumps.

NCMINMAX
  Finds minimal and maximal values of a variable in a NetCDF file.

NCMASK
  Fills the "land" data with 0s or NaNs (NetCDF fill values). For data of type
  float or double the original data outside the mask is preserved; data of other
  types is read as doubles and therefore can suffer from round-off errors when
  written back (I guess).
