  PS 20240820
  -- regrid_ll: added option of setting the deflation level.
v0.04
  PS 20240814
   -- Modified ncw_def_var_as() to call ncw_copy_atts() rather than just copying
      non-special atttributes in a cycle.
v0.03
  PS 20240814
  -- regrid_ll: added option "-m" for NaN fill (default = zero fill).
v0.02
  PS 20240814
  -- ncu_readvarfloat(): fixed mismatch between allocation and deallocation
     conditions (could lead to memory leak).
  -- ncu_readfield(): read into native type if (vartype != NC_FLOAT), not if
     (typesize != ncw_sizeof(NC_FLOAT)) used before. The old condition could
     lead to wrong treatment of fill values etc.
v0.01
  PS 20240802
  -- regrid_ll: allow only one input point in the tiny circle around the south
     pole for the south projection and around the north pole for the north
     projection; otherwise delaunay tringulation related stuff has numeric
     problems. (This should not ffect results.)
  -- regrid_ll: fixed mask setup for the destination grid.
